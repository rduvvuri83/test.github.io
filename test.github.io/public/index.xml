      <description>I have deployed my first shiny app when I was working on the Problem Set # 3
This was a challenging yet rewarding assignment where we were given clear instructions and chunks of code
In order to complete this assignment, one has to understand the concept of reactivity and how to render reactive data elements.
Below is the final code that I have deployed and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</description>

      <description>Spring 2019: DSBA5122 (May 1st 2019)Visual Analytics is my first course in the DSBA program. The course website was built by Andrew Heiss and the content is managed by Prof.Ryan. Course schedule is very well laid out and it was upto date with the Readings, Assignments and Class material. Datacamp courses are designed in such a way that even a student with no background of R can follow these courses and get upto speed.</description>
