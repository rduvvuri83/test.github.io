      <description>I have deployed my first shiny app when I was working on the Problem Set # 3
This was a challenging yet rewarding assignment where we were given clear instructions and chunks of code
In order to complete this assignment, one has to understand the concept of reactivity and how to render reactive data elements.
Below is the final code that I have deployed and feel free to contact me if you have any questions.</description>
