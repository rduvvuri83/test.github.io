Hello, I am Ravi Duvvuri, a data savy IT professional who is ambitious and getting back to school after almost 10 years to pursue Masters in Data Science program. In my IT career so far, I have implemented couple of Enterprise Dataware Solutions in different capacities that include Requirement Gathering, Architecture, Design, Development and Testing.

Business Intelligence, ETL Development and SQL are my strong areas technically and my communication skills combined with analytical skills help me thrive in customer facing discussions.

When I not busy planning for rest of my life, I enjoy playing cricket, volley ball and I am good at playing chess. I like driving and I drove non-stop for 30 hours when I bough my first car in 2008 from CA to MO.
